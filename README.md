# PilotTask3 - Full Sequence Simulation

Pilot task experiment for master thesis about AIRR data simulation based on full sequences. 

This repo includes:

- full_sequence_simulation
  - Simulates AIRR data from full sequences
- full_sequence_airr_exporter_repertoire
  - Example output from full_sequence_simulation using SimData
- k-mer_filtering_simulation
  - Simulates AIRR data from rejection of sequences containg given motif
- k-mer_airr_exporter_repertoire
  - Example output from k-mer_filtering_simulation using SimData
- SimData:
  - Example datasets of amino acid sequences used for input in the simulation
  - Positive data generated from VDJdb
  - Negative data generated from OLGA
